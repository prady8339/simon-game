# [SIMON GAME](https://prady8339.github.io/simon-game/)

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skills invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J.
By playing this game children can increase their sequential processing, short-term memory, attention, and visual processing with these sound and light mimicking games.
## HOW TO PLAY GUIDE

```bash
1-player Game

1. Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

2. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses
, in order.

3. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

5. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound.
 This means you have lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
